The goal of `movedesign` is to assist researchers in designing movement ecology studies related to two main research questions: the estimation of home range and of speed and distance traveled.

Movement ecology studies frequently make use of data collected from animal tracking projects. Planning a successful animal tracking project requires careful consideration and clear objectives. It is crucial to plan ahead and understand how much data is required to accurately answer your chosen research questions, and choose the optimal tracking regime or schedule.

The app was built using the `golem` framework.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `movedesign` like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
