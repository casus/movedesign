## Overview

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The `movedesign` `R` package and `Shiny` application are designed to support researchers in the planning and evaluation of movement ecology studies, focusing on two key targets: estimating home range areas, and estimating movement speed and distance traveled.

Movement ecology studies frequently make use of data collected from animal tracking projects. Planning a successful animal tracking project requires careful consideration and clear objectives. It is crucial to plan ahead and understand how much data is required to accurately answer your chosen research questions, and choose the optimal tracking regime or schedule.

To assist with study design, `movedesign` integrates the continuous-time methods available with the [`ctmm`](https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/) `R` package. Animal movement is inherently autocorrelated (locations are similar as a function of space and time) and the `ctmm` package allows us to model these data as continuous-time stochastic processes, while dealing with other known biases (such as small sample sizes, irregular or missing data, and location error).

This app was built using the `golem` framework.

## Installation:

To install the stable version of `movedesign`, run the following:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ecoisilva/movedesign")
```

If you encounter any issues, consult the installation troubleshooting [vignette](https://ecoisilva.github.io/movedesign/articles/installation.html) for potential solutions.

## Running the `movedesign` application:

To launch `movedesign`, load the library and run the following command in your `R` console:

``` r
library(movedesign)
movedesign::run_app()
```

## Using the `movedesign` application:

Start with the guided tutorial in the `'Home'` tab. For a more detailed introduction, refer to the [vignette](https://ecoisilva.github.io/movedesign/articles/tutorial.html) or the [manuscript](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14153).
