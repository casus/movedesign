# Installation issues:

## Package dependencies:

The `movedesign` package requires many non-default packages. If you are met with errors during install/upgrade, restart your R session (in the RStudio menu bar, this is `Session` > `Restart R`) and install again to potentially solve the problem. 

## Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub

**Step 1:** Generate a GitHub personal access token with the following command in the RStudio console:
```r
usethis::create_github_token()
```
This will take you to GitHub to generate a token. Configure the token (or just scroll down and generate it using the default settings) and copy it to your clipboard.

**Step 2:** Save the personal access token in your R environment. Return to RStudio and enter:
```
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
in the console. This opens a new window in RStudio. When that window opens, write:
```
GITHUB_PAT="GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
where `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the token (a string of letters and numbers) you just copied from GitHub.

**Step 3:** Save this file, close it, and restart R. After that, you should be good able to install `movedesign`.
