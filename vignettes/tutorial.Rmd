Here, you will be guided step-by-step through the app. At times, you will be prompted to perform a specific action, which will be highlighted. Please take care to follow these instructions, since later parts of the tour require that all previous steps are performed. If no action is requested, simply proceed to the next step by clicking on the 'Next' button or using the right arrow of your keyboard.

**Warning:** do not interact with anything outside of highlighted zones create alongside the tutorial boxes. This tutorial will not cover definitions in detail, but you can check out the more comprehensive `r fa("circle-question")` help tips at any time.
