## Why `movedesign`?
`movedesign` is built using R language with Shiny for an easy-to-use user interface (GUI). This application will allow you to test different tracking regimes while considering an initially set research question (currently *home range* and *speed/distance* estimation). 

* Doesn't require R coding experience.
* Leverages the `ctmm` R package for statistically unbiased methods.
