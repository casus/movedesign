# Overview

```{r, include = FALSE}

library(fontawesome)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The application includes a built-in guided tutorial to help you navigate its features. When you open the `'Home'` tab, you'll find the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecoisilva/movedesign/main/inst/app/www/tutorial_img1.png")

```

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the app, ensuring you understand its features and functionality. When an action is required, it will be clearly [highlighted]{style="color: white; background: #009DA0;"}. Please follow these instructions carefully, as each step builds on the previous one. If no action is needed, simply continue to the next step by clicking `'Next'` or pressing the right arrow key on your keyboard.

**Warning:** Avoid interacting with anything outside the highlighted zones during the tutorial, as this may disrupt the guided experience.

This tutorial provides an overview of key features but does not cover detailed definitions. For more in-depth explanations, you can access comprehensive `r fa("circle-question")` help tips at any time. Documentation is also available on [@movedesia].

## 1. Setting a workflow

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecoisilva/movedesign/main/inst/app/www/tutorial_img2.png")

```

These are the current options for `movedesign` workflows. Users may configure their study design by selecting different options for data source, research target, and analytical target.

1.1. `Data Source`

Users can specify how they want to obtain data:

-   `Upload`: Import a dataset from a local file.
-   `Select`: Choose from pre-existing datasets available in the application.
-   `Simulate`: Generate synthetic data for testing or modeling purposes.

1.2. `Research Target`

Users can define their primary research focus:

-   `Home range`: Analyze long-term space-use requirements.
-   `Speed & distance`: Investigate movement metrics such as speed and distance traveled.

1.3. `Analytical Target`

Users can decide on the type of statistical analysis:

-   `Individual estimate`: Obtain metrics for a single individual.
-   `Mean estimate of sampled population`: Obtain a mean estimate across a sampled group.
-   `Compare estimates of two sampled populations`: Perform a comparative analysis between two groups.

Additionally, users have the option to:

-   `Add individual variation`: Include variation among individuals during simulation.

All workflows follows a stepwise approach, with tabs presented in sequence.

## Study design of an individual estimate

Workflow based on [@silva2023movedesign].

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", eval=TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecoisilva/movedesign/main/inst/app/www/tutorial_img3.png")

```

You will be guided through a real animal tracking project available through the package. To simulate data from scratch, exit the tour (click the `Ã—` button above the tutorial box) and navigate to the `r fa("file-pen", fill = "  #009DA0")` `'Simulate data'` tab, where another guided tour is available.

First, we will navigate to (1) the `r fa("file-circle-plus", fill = "   #009DA0")` `'Select data'` tab to load a dataset available within the package. Then, we will move to (2) the `r fa("stopwatch", fill = "    #009DA0")` `'Sampling design'` tab to define the sampling duration and interval. Finally, we will proceed to (3) the `r fa("compass-drafting")` `'Analyses'` tab.
